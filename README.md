# Data-storage-and-management--HBase--MongoDB-and-NoSQL-databases
The objective of this project was to analyse and understand the characteristics of HBase, MongoDB and NoSQL databases.
This paper is about performance analysis of HBase and MongoDB which are most widely used non-relational database management systems. 
This study shows the performance comparison for the outputs of HBase and MongoDB which is obtained by applying different workloads. 
This comparison will help users to choose the database as per the requirements. These databases support big data applications. 
For performance analysis, YCSB (Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark) is used (Cattell, 2010). 
Horizontal scalability is One of the key features of NoSQL databases. Along with horizontal scalability, 
it also has the capability to manage a large amount of data. Due to this feature NoSQL databases are one of the leading cloud 
platforms
